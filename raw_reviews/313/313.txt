"So this device just came out this morning, and I hadn't planned on buying it but I was down at my local best buy store and played with it just to see what it was and loved it! Let me say I used to have all apple stuff, apple computer, iphone, ipad, etc. Over the last year my apples have rotted, went bad and needed to be replaced. Instead of paying high dollar for all new apple stuff I went back to a windows PC, an Andorid Galaxy S2 phone, still had the iPad but it was in need of replacement."
I have a
It was my birthday and my family asked me what I wanted.  I decided a new toy would be nice.
"This is a brand new product from Samsung that breaks the $250 price barrier. There are a lot of tablets at or below this price but they are mostly very low end devices with slow CPUs, poor screens and built for non-US markets.  The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 makes none of the compromises typical of this price point and provides the same kind of performance you'd expect from the rest of the Samsung Galaxy Tab portfolio. It's fast, slick, has a great screen and even has Android 4.03 (Ice Cream Sandwich).  I do like the new operating system and adapted to it in minutes.  In addition to front & rear cameras there is bluetooth and even an IR blaster so you can use it as a remote for your TV. It only took a minute to set that up and get a program guide downloaded.  All the apps on my Gingerbread phone loaded up to the Tab and run fine on the ICS platform. I can't comment on battery life yet as I plugged it for the initial charge and setup and haven't run on battery yet.  As far as WiFi reception goes, it picks up all the same signals at the same strength as my laptop so no problem there."
EDIT 03/16/2013)
"I was a heartbeat away from buying a B&N; tablet until I saw that this tablet was about to be released. I have to say, the wait was worth it."
"I have had the original Galaxy Tab 7 for about a year.  It love it.  7"" is the perfect size to bring along to read a book or watch a movie.  It is large enough to be able to pull up web pages (even in ""full Site"" mode) and actually read them.  I have used that old work horse every day that I've owned it."
"If you are looking for a 7"", well-functioning, affordable tablet to surf the web and consume content then this the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is one of the best options out there. I own a Kindle Fire and love it. It is all that I need when I'm ready to relax in the evening. However, the Galaxy Tab gets the advantage for being a budget media tablet. Here is why:"
"We have the latest Apple's iPad 3 at home but one thing I needed for my personal use was for email and having something that's more compact to carry around.  As much as 10"" tablets are nice, they are still hefty and aren't the easiest thing to type on especially on non-Android system (lack of aftermarket keyboard option for example).  I've also added some in-depth review towards the bottom."
"I've been hunting down a 7"" tablet since I saw the specs for the ASUS MeMo 370T and was happy to see this Samsung unit beat Google to the punch."
"Ok, the title of my review might be a little extreme but I stick by it.  Anyone considering a Nook or Kindle should give this tablet a long, hard look.  For an entry level, low cost tablet it has a lot of features the purpose built readers leave out.  Not the least of which is this tablet is not tied to Barnes & Noble or Amazon.  With this tablet you can get content from anywhere you want.  Also, the Samsung has a GPS, front and rear cameras and a memory card slot.  I believe the Nook has a memory slot too but the Kindle does not.  The Samsung also has an IR blaster for controlling your home theater."
"Like the first review, I wasn't planning on buying this today...but after playing with the Fire and Nook and being underwhelmed with their performance, I almost left Best Buy empty handed. We stumbled upon this, and I loved it. My main problem with the other two was that they seemed very sluggish (compared to the iPad2 my fiancé has). This on the other hand, is finally a quick and responsive 7"" tablet at nearly the same price as Fire. Apps just launch, graphic intensive magazine pages flow, and the touch screen keyboard is easy to use with my relatively large hands. What's more is you aren't locked into anything, get a very accurate GPS, a smart remote, bluetooth, and a nice and bright screen. I'm sure I'll be adding more praises as time goes by."
"So I did a lot of research; I've been in the market for a tablet for 5 or 6 weeks. I really wanted to wait for the Asus/Google Nexus announcement, but I don't want to hang out that long on the hope that it will be announced and have everything I want. This tablet has almost everything on my list I'll detail out why it got a 4 from me in a minute."
"I periodically review the comments on this product, and am disappointed in some of the reasons given for providing low ratings; therefore I am submitting the following general information and suggestions."
"This is my first tablet and I bought it mainly for college purposes.  In addition to owning hard copies of my textbooks, I also have pdf files of them and needed a device I could save and open them (instead of lugging around 25 lbs of books).  I also needed to browse the internet as some of my homework is online and needed flash support for the occasional cramster/chegg help.  I HATE having to use the library's computers on campus.  The people are a distraction, but I do not want to lug around my laptop or deal with it's crappy battery.  So, I bought the Tab 2."
"Very impressed with Amazon's delivery on a SUNDAY, at that!  I pre-ordered and assumed I'd get it on Monday or Tuesday with my Prime delivery, but was surprised at to see it at my door today!"
"I am what you would call a power user. I was looking for a 7 inch tablet after using and returning an ASUS Transformer due to its size and lack of video codecs. I needed a small tablet to read books, surf the web, play games, take class notes, and watch videos. After being disappointed at the Amazon locked Kindle Fire, not wanting to pay a high premium for an iPad, and the Nexus 7 lacking an expandable storage option, I found the Tab 2 7.0 a worthy tablet that hits all the points important to me."
"Have been using a friend's iPad 2, and really like it -but- it's a PITA to carry around. I tried a Kindle Fire, and it fit in my back pocket, but it didn't do much other than read books. Amazon sold the little Android guy without legs: only Kindle Fire apps will download and run on the corrupted opsys."
"I bought this recently.  It is a fine tablet, except for one MAJOR flaw. You will never be able to do anything with your SD card other than use it to hold pictures and videos.  Even books cannot go on the card.  Instead, Samsung creates a fake SD card space inside your limited 4gb free internal memory, and any ap that wants to access the SD card is sent there.  I am unclear if this can be circumvented by rooting the device.  As far as I can tell, even those aps that use music and videos may have a hard time accessing the sd card to get to them.  So far I have only been able to copy stuff to the card via a PC and then if it is music or video the stock built-in ap can see it. But I am not sure even the normal music and video aps (like podcasting aps) can even write to the card (although that may be something I can overcome, I am not sure)."
"Let me first say that this fell out of my bag a few days after I got it, onto the hard floor at school.  I can't see any damage, yay Samsung.  That said, I am getting a case for it. Basically this is a big Android smartphone, with Wifi access only."
"I love this tablet! I purchased two right after the new year and they have been going strong since. Maybe that seems crazy, but I've heard some horror stories about off-brand tablets becoming crap within a few weeks. This tablet has a lot of internal memory and runs android. The battery keeps its charge well, and I haven't had any issues with playback of movies or music, and it plays apps perfectly. I have probably downloaded approximately 20 apps and the system hasn't slowed at all. The WiFi works well, when I take it away from home and come back, it is almost instantaneously picking up the signal. It almost never loses the connection, even when my ps3 or my laptop do."
"I am a newbie to tablets so I can't compare to many different  tablets except the Kindle, which I owned for about 3 days. Got the Kindle for a great deal, $139, special 1-day deal, refurbished direct from Amazon, 1-year warranty. Couldn't pass up this deal.  Played with it for about 3-days. Everything about the Kindle was OK. Nothing great, did everything as advertised."
"I started with a Kindle Fire and was sorely disappointed by how much it lagged, so I exchanged it for the Samsung. I am a HUGE fan of Samsung and have always felt they produce a good quality product. The Galaxy worked great ... at first. The camera in it was good, the surfing was fast (with Chrome), my apps ran a lot smoother than they had on the Fire, the battery life wasn't stellar, but overall I was happy with my purchase. After 3 weeks, however, I went to plug it in and it wouldn't charge at all. Luckily, I was still within my 30 day return window with Amazon and I simply exchanged it. That process was quick, they sent me a new one which arrived in a couple of days (I didn't have to wait for them to get the defective one). I got the new one, got it all updated, apps redownloaded and had it up and running in no time. That same night, I finished using it, shut it off and plugged it in to charge. Next morning, I go to turn on the tablet and its been completely reset to factory defaults, I had to re-enter my information, redownload the apps, etc. Figured it was just a fluke, but sure enough, the next time I turned it back on after turning it off, it did the same thing again. I packed it back up and sent it back to Amazon within 2 days of getting it. This time I've just gotten a refund. I am sadly disappointed. For the ""value tabs"" I felt this was the best one available, especially with the option to add a memory card (the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire don't). Guess, I'm waiting a little longer to find a great tablet."
"I did a few weeks' worth of searching and comparing before I bought The Tab 2 7.0, and this tablet offers more bang for the buck than any other tablet in its size and price point."
"I received my Galaxy 2 7"" tablet right before Memorial Day. I liked the device itself when I purchased it. It had a micro SD slot and had received pretty good reviews. The price was great as well. The device worked as expected for the first 36 days after purchase. It then started having issues. It started with random reboots. I was not worried as first as I throw a lot at my tablets. A few weeks later the screen would no longer come on. I tried all the tips and the device would not respond at all. I plugged it in and unplugged it and held the power key for about 60 seconds. The device would boot but as soon as the screen would turn off it would die again."
I've been an Android user for a long time...I was looking for a tablet to read some books and have a bigger screen for some of my applications since I'm a computer tech and I work using remote software and other applications...after a lot of research and having a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone for a year (and extremely happy with it) I decided to go for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0...
"Have owned an iPhone for 2+ years now, an Android 2.2 phone - and recently bought the Kindle Fire for my wife. I don't want to be locked or tied down - which is my experience with the Apple OS.  The OS just works ... but I wanted more freedom. I am agnostic when it comes to operating systems."
"I bought this for my wife.  I have a droid x (i put ICS on it) and she has a galaxy nexus.  Prior to these phones we've had the droid incredible, iphone, droid 1, I also have had an asus transformer TF101 for a year and we've had an ipad1 ... so we have a lot of history with this tech although she is not a ""tech"" person, she just likes things that work and help her organize her life."
"After 3 weeks, the screen went completely dark. I've gone to online chat rooms for help and I see that this problem is disturbingly common."
I started looking for a replacement for my 2 year old B&N; NOOK Color a couple of weeks ago. One local store had the Nexus 7 and this Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Another store had the Acer Iconia A110. My choice was between these 3. I will begin with the one that I first rejected.
"I thought that the product was great because it was limitless, but I recently found out that this is not the case. I bought the 8Gb drive expecting to use the external drive once I filled the internal drive, but this is not the case. To start out with half of the 8Gb is taken up by the tablets firmware and bloatware. That leaves a piddly 4Gb to use for apps. From what I have gleaned from my research and talking to Samsung, Samsung has disabled the ability to move your apps to the SD card. So, if you buy and download apps, which I guess you would because that is what Droid is about, you will NOT want to purchase this product. From my experience apps that you cannot move include: games, apps that use the internet for push updates, and apps that download offline content (some of mine are close to 1Gb by themselves). I would not recommend this product. If you are going to be limited by Samsung and have to store all of your content on the internal drive, you might as well get an iPad. The features are great, the speed is great,and the definition is great."
"I have an aging iPad 1, and have been looking for suitable alternatives. First I tried the Kindle Fire. It's a nice device, but the restrictions from Amazon make the iPad look positively open source. In retrospect, I think that for what a 7 inch device should do, it's a great buy. That, after having the galaxy for a month. I have an android phone, have had a rooted Nook Color, and a Wooted Xoom - so I think I've tested enough varied waters to avoid the inevitable fanboy accusation."
"This is a great tablet. For $250, you will not find a better deal. I have tried the Kindle Fire and the Nook Tablet, and the restrictions in the OS make them fall short compared to the Galaxy Tab 2. Ice Cream Sandwich is sleek, quickly to respond, and very customizable. The best Android OS out there so far, without doubt! I dare to say it's even more customizable than OS X / OS 5 in some aspects. There are numerous apps and it allows for third party apps to be installed as well."
Pros:
"I bought this tablet in 09/12. For the first two weeks it was great, the it froze up. I called Samsung about it and they had my ship it back to them. Got it back two weeks later working again. After playing with it for a couple of days the battery finally needed to be charged. So pluged it in for about fours. When I went to check on it the battery meter showed that it was lower then when I pluged it in. I called Samsung again about it and they had my ship it back to them. Got it back two to three weeks later working again with a full charge on it. Played with it again to drain the battery to see if it would charge. Well it wouldn't. By now I have been without a fixed tablet for three months. I've shipped it to them twice already. Called Samsung want a complete exchange. They said sure no problem. Told me it was approved and that the nearest UPS store will contact me when the new tablet has arrived for me to do an even exchange. They said it could take up to 5 days. On the 5th day, Samsung called me and told me that they made a mistake and can not the UPS even exchange. Now they want me to give them my credit card info for there file and to put on hold. Then they will ship a new tablet out to me in 10-14 days. Or they can process the exchange to where I send them my broken ""P.O.S"" tablet to them and wait another 14-21 days to get a new one. All of that is after they approve my exchange request and email my a return shipping label. Well I'm still waiting on the email. Its going to be aleast 5 months before I have a working tablet."
"I wasn't sure about this tablet when I first ordered it because I was so used to my iPad.  To my surprise, I was very pleased with my new galaxy tab 2.  I really got all the same features with this tablet plus more than I had with theiPad.  I wad really tired of having to do everything through itunes. Now, I can upload, delete, backup, and add without worrying about having to hook up top another computer. Life us so much easier!"
"I really do enjoy my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 - The tablet was at a great price, it is fast and is well built - however, there are some quirks and some Samsung-isms that detract from what is overall a very nice 7"" tablet.  I'll try to be brief but thorough, scroll to the bottom for the cliff-notes."
"Let me start this review by saying that I do own a ""New"" Ipad.  I do love the Ipad I wanted a smaller tablet, something that I could put into my pocket if possible, but something smaller and easier to transport."
"After doing literally days worth of research on tablets within my budget, it came down to the Kindle Fire, B&N; Nook, Blackberry Playbook, and this device. All retailing for less than $300, but after reviewing the specs of the aforementioned devices over and over, and watching many Youtube video's, and reading countless posts and discussions on this device I went ahead and pre-ordered it. First off, I tip my hat to Amazon, who got this sexy piece of technology to me a mere day after it's release (keep up the good work guys). Now on to the review."
"I was loving this device until this past week.  I was using it primarily as an eReader and was thrilled with it.  This past week it began shutting off while in use, and it would not restart after a shutdown.  I can plug it into the charger for approximately 24 hours and it will then usually restart.  On this last incident it refuses to restart after several days on the charger."
"So this device just came out this morning, and I hadn't planned on buying it but I was down at my local best buy store and played with it just to see what it was and loved it! Let me say I used to have all apple stuff, apple computer, iphone, ipad, etc. Over the last year my apples have rotted, went bad and needed to be replaced.

I was actually going to wait for the 2nd generation Kindle in hopes that it would include a memory card slot.  It didn't take long to fill up 16GB on my iPad so I wasn't going to downgrade when I got a 7"" device.  But I have to thank Amazon for setting the price bar for 7"" devices to a more affordable level.  At $249 for a tablet with 8GB and memory card up to 32GB, on a 2nd generation device, the Galaxy Tab 2 is the best buy out there right now."
Got my hands on one today.
Pros:
"After doing literally days worth of research on tablets within my budget, it came down to the Kindle Fire, B&N; Nook, Blackberry Playbook, and this device. All retailing for less than $300, but after reviewing the specs of the aforementioned devices over and over, and watching many Youtube video's, and reading countless posts and discussions on this device I went ahead and pre-ordered it. First off, I tip my hat to Amazon, who got this sexy piece of technology to me a mere day after it's release (keep up the good work guys). Now on to the review."
"I am a newbie to tablets so I can't compare to many different  tablets except the Kindle, which I owned for about 3 days. Got the Kindle for a great deal, $139, special 1-day deal, refurbished direct from Amazon, 1-year warranty. Couldn't pass up this deal.  Played with it for about 3-days. Everything about the Kindle was OK. Nothing great, did everything as advertised."
This is a great priced tablet by a reputable brand. It is much heavier than the iPad mini tough and the screen is certainly not as big. But for the price is a good alternative if you don't want to buy a iPad mini.
"I did a few weeks' worth of searching and comparing before I bought The Tab 2 7.0, and this tablet offers more bang for the buck than any other tablet in its size and price point."
"I bought this for my wife.  I have a droid x (i put ICS on it) and she has a galaxy nexus.  Prior to these phones we've had the droid incredible, iphone, droid 1, I also have had an asus transformer TF101 for a year and we've had an ipad1 ... so we have a lot of history with this tech although she is not a ""tech"" person, she just likes things that work and help her organize her life."
